# PRD: Code Quality Improvements for Weather MCP Server

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This document outlines the requirements for improving the code quality of the Weather MCP Server. The goal is to enhance maintainability, testability, and documentation while ensuring backward compatibility. The improvements will focus on the existing functionality without adding new features.

## 2. Goals
- Improve code maintainability and testability
- Add comprehensive test coverage for existing functionality
- Enhance code documentation and project structure
- Enforce consistent code style and quality
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing integrations

## 3. User Stories
- As a developer, I want clear documentation so I can understand and modify the codebase easily
- As a maintainer, I want comprehensive tests so I can make changes with confidence
- As a new team member, I want a well-structured project so I can onboard quickly
- As an integrator, I want backward compatibility so my existing integrations continue to work

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. The codebase must be reorganized into a standard Python package structure
2. Unit tests must be added for all existing functionality
3. All functions must include complete docstrings following Google style
4. A comprehensive README must be created with setup and usage instructions
5. Project structure and contribution guidelines must be documented
6. Code style must be enforced using `black` and `flake8`
7. Type hints must be added throughout the codebase
8. Error handling must be consistent and well-documented

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Adding new features or modifying existing functionality
- Implementing integration tests with external services
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines
- Performance optimization
- Adding new dependencies beyond testing tools

## 6. Design Considerations
### Project Structure
```
weather/
├── src/
│   └── weather/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── server.py      # MCP server implementation
│       ├── nws_client.py  # NWS API client
│       └── models.py      # Data models
├── tests/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── test_server.py
│   └── test_nws_client.py
├── .flake8
├── .gitignore
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
└── CONTRIBUTING.md
```

### Code Style
- Line length: 88 characters (black default)
- Use double quotes for strings (black default)
- Follow PEP 8 with flake8 for style enforcement
- Use type hints throughout the codebase

## 7. Technical Considerations
### Dependencies
- Add development dependencies:
  - `pytest` for testing
  - `pytest-asyncio` for async test support
  - `pytest-cov` for test coverage
  - `black` for code formatting
  - `flake8` for linting
  - `mypy` for static type checking

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests should mock external dependencies
- Focus on testing the public API of modules
- Test both success and error cases
- Aim for >80% test coverage

## 8. Success Metrics
- 100% of public functions have docstrings
- >80% test coverage
- No flake8 or mypy errors
- All tests pass
- Backward compatibility is maintained

## 9. Open Questions
- Are there any specific code coverage requirements beyond 80%?
- Should we include any additional documentation beyond what's specified?
- Are there any specific performance considerations we should document?

## 10. Implementation Plan
1. Set up project structure
2. Add development dependencies
3. Implement code style and quality checks
4. Refactor existing code into new structure
5. Add type hints and docstrings
6. Write unit tests
7. Update documentation
8. Verify backward compatibility
9. Run final quality checks
10. Submit for review
